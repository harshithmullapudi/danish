# Danish Prakash — Introduction

## About

Hi, I'm Danish Prakash—most people call me Danish. I'm an engineer, developer, and technical writer currently living in Bengaluru, India. My days are most often spent reading (ranging from philosophy to technical deep-dives), building personal knowledge systems, and exploring the city by bicycle or on foot. Fitness is a steady thread in my life; I'm regularly tracking progress on Strava and Hevy, and I treat my workouts with the same intentionality as my writing. When not deep in a book or code, I'll be experimenting with photography—often posting curated collections on Unsplash—or reflecting through journaling, aiming to document both personal growth and lessons learned.

## Work

I currently work at SUSE, focusing on building and improving container infrastructure and developer tools for distributed systems. My primary responsibilities involve enhancing the automation and reliability of modern container platforms, optimizing for reproducibility and developer experience across varied Linux environments. Most projects here involve extensive work in Go and Python, leveraging container runtimes, Kubernetes concepts, and internal deployment tooling, all with an eye on minimalism and composability.

Previously, I spent two years at HackerRank, where I was responsible for core infrastructure projects around remote code execution and developer tooling. My work focused on making the execution of arbitrary code secure, efficient, and robust for millions of users worldwide. This meant working with containerization, distributed sandbox environments, and on-demand resource scheduling, mostly in cloud-based Linux backends using Go, Python, and container orchestration. During earlier internships, I contributed to building internal tools for engineering productivity—streamlining developer onboarding, note-taking, and workflow automation—frequently employing static site generators, Markdown tooling, and Linux scripting.

My technical interests cluster around developer tooling, distributed systems, automation, and minimal, reproducible workspaces. I've dedicated substantial time to automating personal knowledge workflows: writing custom Vim plugins, scripting Anki flashcard integration, and developing static site generators tailored for structured writing and review. Most of my code is written in Go or Python, with recurring themes of friction removal (automating journaling, code reviews, publishing) and long-term knowledge organization. Open source contributions are an essential part of this practice—primarily in projects I rely on day-to-day, such as [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), various Markdown tooling, and my own [public repositories](https://github.com/danishprakash). I also maintain a curated set of workflow utilities and share technical documentation at [danishpraka.sh](https://danishpraka.sh).

The systems and problems that engage me most include: designing for reproducible research and writing pipelines, reducing cognitive overhead in daily work (via templates and automated scripts), supporting healthy developer practices, and exploring the intersection of technology with personal effectiveness.

## Setup

My development workflow prioritizes minimalism, transparency, and automation. I live in Neovim (custom monochromatic theme), manage versions and collaboration through GitHub, and use Obsidian for research and long-form drafting. Knowledge work is structured in Markdown (with heavy cross-referencing and templating), deployed via a custom static site generator ([kizai](https://github.com/danishprakash/kizai)) on Linux. Anki supports spaced repetition for language and technical review; Strava and Hevy track fitness metrics and routines. Most tinkering happens in Go, Python, and Bash, aided by custom Vim plugins that automate repetitive editing and publishing tasks.

I document all major workflow changes and environment tweaks in [annual reviews](/tags/year-in-review) and technical posts on my website, aiming to enable reproducibility for both myself and other technically inclined readers. My setup is intentionally fluid and continuously revised, guided by first-principles experimentation and ongoing critical reflection.
